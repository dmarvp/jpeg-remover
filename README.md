# Jpeg Remover

Jpeg remover is a console app that does one simple task: It deletes duplicate jpeg files from a given folder, 
given there is RAW file with the same name. It also has an option to just list the duplicate jpegs in case you 
want to make sure before deleting them.

This console app was created out of necessity since I'm a photography enthusiast running out of space on his 
hard drive ;)

## Installation
Simply download and extract [JpegRemover.zip](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jnx68l1emi5u3sc/JpegRemover.zip?dl=0) to a folder on your pc.

## Usage
Open a command window, navigate to the folder where the main exe is and type in:

`JpegRemoverConsole.exe "<The path of the folder to look for duplicates>"`

e.g.
`JpegRemoverConsole.exe "C:\MyPictures\MyLastTrip"`
